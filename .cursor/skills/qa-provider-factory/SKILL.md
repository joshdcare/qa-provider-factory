# QA Provider Factory

CLI tool that creates provider accounts at specific enrollment checkpoints, so QA can test any point in the flow without manually clicking through enrollment.

- **Web**: Drives a real Chromium browser through the enrollment pages, stopping at the target page with the browser open for manual testing.
- **Mobile**: Uses API calls to set up account state at specific checkpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Playwright Chromium: `npx playwright install chromium`
- A `.env` file in the project root with:

```
CZEN_API_KEY=<Care.com API key>
STRIPE_KEY=<Stripe test key — required for mobile upgraded/fully-enrolled>
MYSQL_DB_PASS_DEV=<MySQL read-only password — required for mobile fully-enrolled, optional otherwise>
```

Ask a team lead for these values if you don't have them.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd qa-provider-factory
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run dev -- --step <step> --platform <platform> [--vertical <vertical>] [--tier basic|premium]
```

## Supported Verticals

| Vertical | `--vertical` flag | Status |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Child Care | `childcare` (default) | Validated |
| Senior Care | `seniorcare` | Best-effort — validate by running |
| Pet Care | `petcare` | Best-effort — validate by running |
| Housekeeping | `housekeeping` | Best-effort — validate by running |
| Tutoring | `tutoring` | Best-effort — validate by running |

## Enrollment Steps

### Web steps (`--platform web`, default)

Web uses Playwright to navigate a real browser through each enrollment page. The browser stays open at the target step for manual testing.

| Step | URL / Page |
|------|-----------|
| `at-get-started` | `/app/vhp/get-started` |
| `at-soft-intro-combined` | `/app/vhp/provider/soft-intro-combined` |
| `at-vertical-selection` | `/app/vhp/vertical-triage` |
| `at-location` | `/app/enrollment/provider/mv/location` |
| `at-preferences` | `/app/enrollment/provider/mv/preferences` |
| `at-family-count` | `/app/enrollment/provider/mv/family-count` |
| `at-account-creation` | `/app/enrollment/provider/mv/account/combined` |
| `at-family-connection` | `/app/enrollment/provider/mv/family-connection` |
| `at-safety-screening` | `/app/enrollment/provider/mv/safety-screening` |
| `at-subscriptions` | `/app/ratecard/provider/rate-card` |
| `at-basic-payment` | `/app/checkout` (Basic tier) |
| `at-premium-payment` | `/app/checkout` (Premium tier) |
| `at-app-download` | `/app/enrollment/provider/mv/app-download` |

Steps before `at-account-creation` land on the page without creating an account. Steps after `at-account-creation` create the account and print credentials.

### Mobile steps (`--platform mobile`)

Mobile uses API calls to set up account state at each checkpoint.

| Step | Where the user lands |
|------|---------------------|
| `account-created` | Account exists, at "Where are you looking for jobs?" |
| `at-build-profile` | At "Build Your Profile" screen |
| `at-availability` | Profile built, at "Your availability" screen |
| `profile-complete` | Availability + bio set, past profile |
| `upgraded` | Subscription purchased (use `--tier`) |
| `at-disclosure` | At disclosure screen |
| `fully-enrolled` | BGC cleared, fully enrolled |

## Common Commands

```bash
# Web — stop at the location page (default: childcare)
npm run dev -- --step at-location --platform web

# Web — senior care at vertical selection
npm run dev -- --step at-vertical-selection --platform web --vertical seniorcare

# Web — stop at basic checkout page
npm run dev -- --step at-basic-payment --platform web

# Web — stop at premium checkout page
npm run dev -- --step at-premium-payment --platform web

# Web — stop at account creation form
npm run dev -- --step at-account-creation --platform web

# Mobile — user at availability screen
npm run dev -- --step at-availability --platform mobile

# Mobile — fully enrolled premium user
npm run dev -- --step fully-enrolled --platform mobile --tier premium

# Mobile — senior care fully enrolled
npm run dev -- --step fully-enrolled --platform mobile --vertical seniorcare --tier premium

# Mobile — pet care at build profile
npm run dev -- --step at-build-profile --platform mobile --vertical petcare
```

## Output

### Web output (before account creation)

```
  ⏳ Starting web enrollment flow...

  ✓ at-get-started
  ✓ at-soft-intro-combined
  ✓ at-vertical-selection
  ✓ at-location

✓ Browser stopped at: at-preferences
  URL: https://www.dev.carezen.net/app/enrollment/provider/mv/preferences

  Suggested credentials (for the account creation step):
    Email:      prov-abc123@care.com
    Password:   letmein1

  Close the browser when you're done.
```

### Web output (after account creation)

Steps past `at-account-creation` print MemberId, UUID, and Vertical — the same info as mobile:

```
  ✓ at-account-creation
  ✓ at-family-connection (account created)
  ✓ at-safety-screening

✓ Browser stopped at: at-safety-screening
  URL: https://www.dev.carezen.net/app/enrollment/provider/mv/safety-screening

  Email:      prov-abc123@care.com
  Password:   letmein1
  MemberId:   1774484793
  UUID:       a6fd308d-258b-4c24-8251-0c0e0b5778e0
  Vertical:   CHILD_CARE

  Close the browser when you're done.
```

### Mobile output

```
✓ Provider created at step: fully-enrolled (mobile)

  Email:      prov-xxxxxxxx@care.com
  Password:   letmein1
  MemberId:   1234567
  UUID:       xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  Vertical:   CHILD_CARE
```

## Test Data

All accounts use:
- **Password:** `letmein1`
- **Name:** Martina Goodram
- **ZIP code:** 72204 (entered at the `at-location` step)
- **Address:** 28965 Homewood Plaza, Little Rock, AR 72204
- **DOB:** 07/26/1995
- **SSN:** 490-95-9347 (for IDV/screening pass)
- **Credit card:** 4111 1111 1111 1111, Exp 09/32, CVV 123, Billing ZIP 72204

### What the web flow fills in automatically

| Step | Fields entered |
|------|---------------|
| `at-vertical-selection` | Selects "Child Care" vertical |
| `at-location` | ZIP code `72204` |
| `at-account-creation` | First/last name, email, password, gender, age checkbox |
| `at-basic-payment` / `at-premium-payment` | Name on card, credit card number, expiration, CVV, billing ZIP (via Stripe Elements) |

## Known Limitations

### Web selectors

The web flow uses Playwright selectors (role, label, text) to interact with enrollment pages. If a page's UI changes, selectors in `src/steps/web-flow.ts` may need updating. When a selector fails, the browser stays open for debugging.

### Detailed availability calendar (mobile)

The mobile app's "Your Services & Availability" screen reads from a legacy MySQL calendar table. The factory sets:
- Full-time preference (visible in the app)
- `hasMemberEverFilledOneTimeAvailability` flag (acknowledged)
- REST availability data (Mon-Fri 9am-5pm)

However, the **detailed day/time grid** in the app requires a one-time manual save: open "Your Services & Availability" > tap Edit > Save.

### Platform notes

- **Mobile** targets Android only. iOS enrollment has inconsistencies — avoid iOS for now.
- **Web** and **mobile** use completely different step names and execution strategies.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `CZEN_API_KEY environment variable is required` | Create `.env` with the three required variables |
| `Error: browserType.launch` | Run `npx playwright install chromium` |
| Web flow selector fails | Browser stays open for debugging. Update selectors in `src/steps/web-flow.ts` |
| Auth token fails (mobile) | VPN must be connected for SPI endpoints |
| BGC fails at Sterling callback (mobile) | Check that `MYSQL_DB_PASS_DEV` is set |

### Adding a new web enrollment step

1. Add the step name to `WEB_STEPS` in `types.ts`
2. Add a new block in `runWebEnrollmentFlow()` in `src/steps/web-flow.ts` with the URL wait pattern and page interaction logic

### Adding a new mobile step

1. Add the step name to `MOBILE_STEPS` in `types.ts`
2. Create a runner function in the appropriate `steps/` file
3. Register it in the pipeline array in `src/steps/registry.ts`
